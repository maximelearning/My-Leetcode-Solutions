# My Leetcode Solutions

### Notes

- These solutions are not necessarily the most optimal. Rather they are solutions that made sense to me at the time.
- The graphs directory, problems that involve graph theory solutions. Trees are also included since trees are acyclic connected graphs.
- The misc_algos directory, problems that require some mystery data structures to solve or other general algorithm problems. Contains two pointers, sliding windows, among others.
- The dp directory, stands for dynamic programming, my personal favorite type of algorithm problems.
- The greedy directory, for algorithms where the essence is to use a greedy approach.
- The design directory, for implementations of particular classes.
