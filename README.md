# My Leetcode Solutions

- These solutions are not necessarily the most optimal. Rather they are solutions that made sense to me at the time.

### Notes

- _graphs_: Problems where you are given a graph representation or the solution involves a graph theory application.
- _binary_trees_: Problems where you are given trees (acyclic graphs) where each node has at most 2 children.
- _dynamic_programming_: Problems with solutions involving the algorithm design technique, dynamic programming.
- _linked_lists_: Problems where you are given a linked list to operate on.
- _ptr_or_window_technique_: Problems that use two pointer, sliding window, or a similar technique.
- _greedy_: Problems where a good solution involves a greedy algorithm.
- _design_: Problems that ask for the implementation of classes.
- _misc_algos_: Problems that do not fall into the above categories nicely.
