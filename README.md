# My Leetcode Solutions

### Notes
* These problems are not necessarily the most optimal. Rather they are solutions that made sense to me at the time.
* Tree problems will be found in the graphs directory, as a tree is an acyclic connected graph.
* Problems that require some mystery data structures to solve, will be in the misc_algos directory.
* The directory dp, stands for dynamic programming.
