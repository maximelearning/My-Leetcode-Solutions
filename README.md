# My Leetcode Solutions

- These solutions are not necessarily the most optimal. Rather they are solutions that made sense to me at the time.

### Note

- A problem can fall under more than one category. That being said, I arbitrarily decided where
  the problem best fell under. For example, I tend to believe a string + sliding window problem, should
  be classified as a sliding window problem over string, since it's a more specific and tangible skill to
  aim for.

### Folders

- **arrays** [8]: Problems that have an input array and don't fall nicely under other categories.
- **design** [6]: Problems that ask for the implementation of classes.
- **dp** [7]: Problems with solutions involving the algorithm design technique, dynamic programming.
- **graphs** [5]: Problems where you are given a graph representation or the solution involves a graph theory application.
- **greedy** [3]: Problems where a good solution involves a greedy algorithm.
- **linked_lists** [3]: Problems where you are given a linked list to operate on.
- **matrix** [3]: Problems where the input is a matrix.
- **sliding_window** [3]: Problems that use the sliding window technique.
- **strings** [10]: Problems where the inputs are strings.
- **trees** [20]: Problems where you are given trees (acyclic graphs).
- **two_pointer** [8]: Problems that use two (or three) pointers to solve.
