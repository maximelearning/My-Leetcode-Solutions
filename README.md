# My Leetcode Solutions

- These solutions are not necessarily the most optimal. Rather they are solutions that made sense to me at the time.

### Note

- A problem can fall under more than one category. That being said, I arbitrarily decided where
  the problem best fell under. For example, I tend to believe a string + sliding window problem, should
  be classified as a sliding window problem over string, since it's a more specific and tangible skill to
  aim for.

### Folders

- **graphs**: Problems where you are given a graph representation or the solution involves a graph theory application.
- **binary_trees**: Problems where you are given trees (acyclic graphs) where each node has at most 2 children.
- **dynamic_programming**: Problems with solutions involving the algorithm design technique, dynamic programming.
- **strings**: Problems where the inputs are strings.
- **linked_lists**: Problems where you are given a linked list to operate on.
- **ptr_or_window_technique**: Problems that use two pointer, sliding window, or a similar technique.
- **greedy**: Problems where a good solution involves a greedy algorithm.
- **design**: Problems that ask for the implementation of classes.
- **misc_algos**: Problems that do not fall into the above categories nicely.
